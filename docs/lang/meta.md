Codon supports compile-time metaprogramming through the
special `Literal` type. `Literal`s represent constants which
can be operated on and manipulated *at compile time*. There are three types of `Literal`s:

- `Literal[int]`: integer constant
- `Literal[str]`: string constant
- `Literal[bool]`: boolean constant

## Integer literals

## String literals

## Boolean literals

## Static ranges
